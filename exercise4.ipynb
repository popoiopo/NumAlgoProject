    "In various fields of application (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology), modeling systems as noise-driven motion in a potential landscape has been very successful. Such systems can spend most of their time in or near the bottom of a potential well, and are occasionally triggered by the noise to \"hop over\" to another well. How frequently such transitions occur depends on the noise amplitude. With small noise, transitions occur very infrequently (\"rare events\"), and the potential wells correspond to preferred states or metastable states of the system. Think of the phenomenon of protein folding, with the folded and unfolded states as metastable states.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the noise is small and the potential smooth, transitions typically follow \\textit{minimum energy paths}. An important question is what these paths look like. Answering this question by forward time integration is impractical or even impossible if the transitions are rare (in which case excessively long integrations would be needed to observe just one or a few transitions). Instead, one can try to compute the paths directly using minimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following potential, with $(x_1,x_2) = \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, is frequently used in this context:\n",
    "$$V(x_1,x_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 A_i \\, \\exp \\left( a_i(x_1-\\bar x_1^{(i)})^2 + b_i(x_1-\\bar x_1^{(i)})(x_2-\\bar x_2^{(i)} ) + c_i (x_2-\\bar x_2^{(i)})^2 \\right)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "This potential has three local minima, these can be found by minimization. If we have two states $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ and we want to compute the minimum energy path that connects them, we can create a chain of $N+1$ states $\\{ \\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{x}_1, ..., \\mathbf{x}_N \\}$ with $\\mathbf{x}_0=\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_N=\\mathbf{B}$, and define the energy of the chain as\n",
